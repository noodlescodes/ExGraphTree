 & Implement some sort of threading to search faster.
 - Write solutions to file as they are found (possibly stop after a certain number of solutions). Will probably use another thread to write to file.
 * Have command line argument for which order to search for an ex graph.
 @ Find out maximum degree of vertex, and how many vertices can have that degre.
 @ Find out about n=31 and n=32.


* == easy enough to do.
& == going to take time to get done.
- == important and have to think of a way to do it nicely.
@ == need someone else to get information from.
