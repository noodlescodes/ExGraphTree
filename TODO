 & Implement some sort of threading to search faster. (2014-08-22)
 - Write solutions to file as they are found (possibly stop after a certain number of solutions). Will probably use another thread to write to file. (2014-08-22)
 @ Find out maximum degree of vertex, and how many vertices can have that degre. (2014-08-23)
 @ Find out about n=31 and n=32. (2014-08-23)
 * Change the main file from test.cpp. (2014-08-23)
 * Make a vector in the Matrix class to keep track of the degree of the vertices.


* == easy enough to do.
& == going to take time to get done.
- == important and have to think of a way to do it nicely.
@ == need someone else to get information from.
