 * Add an array that stores the expected number of edges for each graph so I don't have to look it up each time.
 & Implement some sort of threading to search faster.
 - Write solutions to file as they are found (possibly stop after a certain number of solutions). Will probably use another thread to write to file.
 * Adjust Matrix class to add entries symmetrically so it's less code to make predefined matrices for when processing for n == 33 starts.
 * Have command line argument for which order to search for an ex graph.

* == easy enough to do.
& == going to take time to get done
- == important and have to think of a way to do it nicely.
